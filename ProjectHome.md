**NotiMe!** is an open source, free to use Android application, that uses location based services to make sure you are never late for another meeting ever again!

It periodically gets events from your _Google Calendar_ and calculates the time to drive from your current location to the event location (using _Google Maps_). Then, **NotiMe!** notifies you before you have to set out - in order to arrive on time. **NotiMe!** does not affect your _Google Calendar_ data, it only reads information that is relevant for notification purposes.

Currently, **NotiMe!** does not take into consideration traffic or any other volatile information to calculate the necessary time-to-drive. Be aware that **NotiMe!** takes into account only events that have specified location and time.
